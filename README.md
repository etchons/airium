# The Airium Collection
The Airium Collection is a collection of all Airium-related projects (created by etchons, adot, and sandwich man). Airium is a completely real element that exists, and is pure air. You can't find it on the Periodic Table, because John Periodic (founder of the periodic table) didn't include it so that he would be the only one with access to the rare element.
